    <h1>Rolling out the free upgrade to Windows 11<br> in a phased and measured approach</h1>
    <p><big>The free upgrade to Windows 11 starts on October 5 and will be phased and measured with a focus on
            quality.<br> Following the tremendous learnings from Windows 10, we want to make sure we’re providing you
            with the best<br> possible experience. That means new eligible devices will be offered the upgrade first.
            The upgrade will then<br> roll out over time to in-market devices based on intelligence models that consider
            hardware eligibility, reliability<br> metrics, age of device and other factors that impact the upgrade
            experience. We expect all eligible devices to be<br> offered the free upgrade to Windows 11 by mid-2022. If
            you have a Windows 10 PC that’s eligible for the upgrade,<br> Windows Update will let you know when it’s
            available. You can also check to see if Windows 11 is ready for your<br> device by going to Settings >
            Windows Update and select Check for updates*.</big></p>
